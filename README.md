# Deno Exercises

These exercises are meant to be used with the [Deno First Look course](https://burkeholland.github.io/deno-first-look). 

## How To Use

**Optional:** The `main` branch includes a container definition that includes Deno. If you open it with the VS Code [Remote-Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers%3FWT.mc_id%3Ddevcloud-0000-buhollan&WT.mc_id=m365-0000-buhollan), no Deno install is required. Note that the configuration is only in the main branch, so you'll need to be on that in order to build and open the container.

The exercises are broken up into branches. Each branch coincides with a section in the Deno First Look course. Each section in the course will tell you which branch to switch to. Most branches have an "exercise" folder where you are meant to do the work. Make sure you are in that folder when executing commands from your terminal.

As the course progresses, the exercises get more complicated, so a "solutions" folder is present which contains the completed and working exercise for that section.
